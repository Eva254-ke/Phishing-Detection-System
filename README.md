# Phishing-Detection-System
The phishing email classification model is designed to detect and classify emails as either phishing or safe. It is based on a supervised learning algorithm that uses labeled email data to learn patterns that distinguish phishing content from legitimate emails. The model processes email text, including subject, body and any links to capture indicators of phishing attempts.

Preprocessing steps clean and tokenize the text and numerical representations that are generated using  TF-IDF and word embeddings techniques. The transformed data is then fed into a classification algorithm. The dvanced models uses deep learning architecture transformer-based models which capture context and semantic relationships in the text.

The model is trained to minimize misclassification by adjusting its parameters and its performance is evaluated on test data using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score. This allows the model to generalize and accurately classify new, unseen emails in real-world deployment. It provides an automated solution to identify phishing emails thus reducing potential security risks.
